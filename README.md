Bar Crawl App

Technology Stack:
Ruby 2.1.2p95,
Rails 4.2.1,
psql (PostgreSQL) 9.4.1



Requirements:
register for an api key from yelp:
https://www.yelp.com/developers/manage_api_keys
Skeleton CSS framework (recommended)
http://getskeleton.com/
 - download and insert both the normalize.css and skeleton.css into your vendor/assets/stylesheets directory.   


Bar/Tavern information:
https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/Business-Licenses-Current-Liquor-and-Public-Places/nrmj-3kcf
-Filter information
-Download information as CSV
-Drop the CSV into your rails db directory.


Remember to incorporate changes to the gemfile and bundle.


Testing the app:
from within the app's directory in command line:
```
  rails s
```

Database tables (our db is called " bar_crawl_development " ):
```
  List of relations
  Schema |       Name        | Type  |  Owner  
  --------+-------------------+-------+---------
  public | bar_distances     | table | Matthew
  public | bars              | table | Matthew
  public | chats             | table | Matthew
  public | crawls            | table | Matthew
  public | drinkers          | table | Matthew
  public | schema_migrations | table | Matthew
```



This app accepts either a user's current location or a manually entered location and renders options for a bar crawl. The bar options are those that are geographically closest to one another.

The bars are based on a fixed dataset from a list of licensed taverns in Chicago. The Haversine Formula is used to calculate distances between each bar based on latitude and longitude.


```
  def self.search_bars(lat, long, num_bars=1)
    dtor = Math::PI/180
    r = 3959

    rlat1 = lat * dtor
    rlong1 = long * dtor

    bars = self.all  # Find all the bars

    bar_distances = bars.map do |bar| # For each bar in the database
      rlat2 = bar.lat* dtor
      rlong2 = bar.long * dtor

      dlon = rlong1 - rlong2
      dlat = rlat1 - rlat2

      a = (Math::sin(dlat/2) ** 2) + Math::cos(rlat1) * Math::cos(rlat2) * (Math::sin(dlon/2) ** 2)
      c = 2 * Math::atan2(Math::sqrt(a), Math::sqrt(1-a))
      d = r * c

      {
        distance: d,
        id: bar.id
      }
    end

    bar_distances.sort! { |x,y| x[:distance] <=> y[:distance] }

    closest_bars_hashes = bar_distances.slice(0..(num_bars-1))

    closest_bars_hashes.map {|bar_data|  self.find( bar_data[:id] ) }
  end

```
A user's current latitude and longitude is determined through a navigator.geolocation function, while manually entered latitude and longitudes are obtained with the yelp gem. This allows the user to enter not only addresses, but landmarks and more general search terms.

Admins can be manually created in the console by adding a "drinker"
```
  Drinker.create({name: 'Roger', password: 'password1', is_admin: true})
```


Admin has ability to remove bars from the database, by going to the /admin page:
