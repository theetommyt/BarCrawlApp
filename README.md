“CHOOSE YOUR OWN DISASTER”: A Customizable Social Bar Crawl App!

No more interminable group-decision making ordeals just to pre-plan a fun night of dranking!

Trust us, pre-planning drinking works a whole lot better than drunk-planning.

Now you can drink where you want, in the order you want, with the people you want! Choose your own Disaster, in style!

The aspiring drunkard has two ways to start using the App:

(1) Auto-geolocation of current location, or
(2) Enter address for starting location of crawl.

With the google map-view listings of all the closest bars, you can click once on any bar to find more info about the bar you like.

If you like a bar enough to crawl to it, you can double-click on the map icon to add that bar to your Bar Crawl list.
(Version 2: nix bars from list, save individual Crawls for future use  ...)

Once you've selected your perfect Crawl route, you can use the app anywhere you are to recheck new bars closer to you, and add those bars to your list.

While you're on the Crawl, you can be super-social by taking out your phones, ignoring your fellow humans, and using our DrunkChat feature with your fellow Crawlers! Also, sign-up as a new user for DrunkChat, log-in (takes you to profile page) and can redirect back to welcome page, with DrunkChat feature.

When you come back to welcome page, you’re all Logged-in and personally greeted, by name, by your friendly Bartender, Sam!

In DrunkChat, tell your fellow Crawlers how it’s going, and your salty bar reviews, and what drinks you’re imbibing.
Version 2: post your pictures! (Eventually video links  and other media)

Design!
Our intention was for the design to be fun, colorful, spontaneous and easy-to-use in the desired state of the user - Drunk!
